	 * Sets the censoring strategy, which is responsible for generating
	 * replacement text for regions of the text that should be censored.
	 *
	 * The default censoring strategy is the [[grawlixCensorStrategy]],
	 * generating text like `$%@*`. There are several other built-in strategies
	 * available:
	 * - [[keepStartCensorStrategy]] - extends another strategy and keeps the
	 *   first character matched, e.g. `f***`.
	 * - [[keepEndCensorStrategy]] - extends another strategy and keeps the last
	 *   character matched, e.g. `***k`.
	 * - [[asteriskCensorStrategy]] - replaces the text with asterisks, e.g.
	 *   `****`.
	 * - [[grawlixCensorStrategy]] - the default strategy, discussed earlier.
	 *
	 * Note that since censoring strategies are just functions (see the
	 * documentation for [[TextCensorStrategy]]), it is relatively simple to
	 * create your own.
	 *
	 * To ease creation of common censoring strategies, we provide a number of
	 * utility functions:
	 * - [[fixedPhraseCensorStrategy]] - generates a fixed phrase, e.g. `fudge`.
	 * - [[fixedCharCensorStrategy]] - generates replacement strings constructed
	 *   from the character given, repeated as many times as needed.
	 * - [[randomCharFromSetCensorStrategy]] - generates replacement strings
	 *   made up of random characters from the set of characters provided.
	 *
	 * @param strategy - Text censoring strategy to use.

	 * **Overlapping regions**
	 *
	 * Overlapping regions are an annoying edge case to deal with when censoring
	 * text. There is no single best way to handle them, but the implementation
	 * of this method guarantees that overlapping regions will always be
	 * replaced, following the rules below:
	 *
	 * - Replacement text for matched regions will be generated in the order
	 *   specified by [[compareMatchByPositionAndId]];
	 * - When generating replacements for regions that overlap at the start with
	 *   some other region, the start index of the censor context passed to the
	 *   censoring strategy will be the end index of the first region, plus one.
	 *
	 * @param input - Input text.
	 * @param matches - A list of matches.
	 * @returns The censored text.
